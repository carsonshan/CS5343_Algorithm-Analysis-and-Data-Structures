Create an undirected graph of at least 10 vertices and 15 edges.

Draw the graph and include the graph image in your submission.

1. Do A DFS traversal on the graph.
   Print the graph before traversal - adjacency matrix or adjacency list.
   Print the start vertex of your dfs.
   Print the nodes in the order they were visited.

2. Do a BFS traversal for the same graph.
   Print the nodes in the order they are visited for the dfs traversal.
