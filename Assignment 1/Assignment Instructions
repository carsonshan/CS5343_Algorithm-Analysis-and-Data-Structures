1. Create a single linked list of integers. The values in each node must not be sorted.
  The number of nodes in the list must be at least 15.
  Traverse the list and print each value in the node.

2. Sort the list.  Sort it so that you DO NOT swap the values in the nodes. But you MUST swap the complete node.
  Traverse the list again and print each value in the node.
